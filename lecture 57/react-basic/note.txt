js library flexible,
single page application (more pages make but not reloading aur refershing), faster loading bcoz from client side working.
user interface(frontend)
DOM operationally heavy so that network call increases.

react use virtual dom that only use and replace that part that changed. faster call for dom.
Search engine optimisation (SEO ) is very poor due to no reloading and refreshing pages so that only few footfall exist shows seo poor.

component based architecture used in reacts--portion wise(divide and rule code.) can be reused again where can be use call components
2 type of components---class based --stateful, dynamic changes
(ignore the class components)---life cycle method learned important.........

functional based components---stateless, only static changes, 
(use with Hooks for dynamic changes in code to displays.)

js library is Reactjs and nextjs is the reactjs framework with updated versions and stability of new versions that not satble in 18th versions of reactjs.
