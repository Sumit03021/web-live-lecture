  "about": "Unveiled in 2023, the TOLIX UD Table is inspired by the esteemed UD collection, a tribute to the University of Dijon.‎ Echoing the design of the UD chair, this masterful piece features an oak tabletop crafted by a cabinetmaker from the Morvan, elevating the realm of interior design.‎ It skillfully combines the sturdiness of steel with the warmth of wood, showcasing timeless elegance.‎\r\n\r\nDesigned to comfortably seat eight guests, its robust structure and minimalist tabletop epitomize unparalleled functionality.‎ Jean Pauchard, a visionary spirit of his time, would undoubtedly have praised this modern addition, honoring TOLIX's legacy while meeting contemporary tastes.‎ Ideal for discerning interiors, the UD Table transcends mere furniture; it stands as a testament to the renewed French craftsmanship and design.‎\r\n\r\nThe first UD chairs were born in 1958, at the initiative of Jean Pauchard for an order from the University of Dijon.‎ They are characterized by a tubular structure, a perforated backrest with three slender and curved tubes, and a seat padded with Formica and faux leather.‎ Other versions will follow, such as the UD2 chair in 1963 with a beechwood seat.‎\r\n\r\nThe UD chair, characterized by its light and feminine lines, is revisited by Studio Tolix and is accompanied by a table whose delicate curves perfectly complement a steel top that seems to float in suspension.‎ A version with a stained oak top crafted by a Morvan cabinetmaker gives it an even more pronounced character.‎\r\n\r\nThe UD collection stands out with its deep black-brown paint or its glossy white finish.‎ It integrates perfectly into demanding interiors, offering all-steel or all-wood options to meet preferences for minimalism or warmth.‎ In the future, new material will enrich its seating,thereby enhancing its seductive power.‎",

  "about": "Samet Low 81 is a seat element with triangle shaped back cushion upholstered in polyurethanefoam, removable cover.‎ Attention: With KINGSMAN and CORDUROY fabrics, the direction of the stripes runs perpendicular to the quilting.‎ With QUILT MALTA, QUILT VELOUR and 3D fabric, there is no quilting.‎ 3D fabric also provides only inner seam.‎\r\n\r\nSamet Low is a modular sofa without rules, a multifunctional and configurable product that places the person as an active subject in the composition of their own space, encouraging them to experiment with new forms of use.‎ Cosy and hospitable seats are juxtaposed with each other in regular and soft geometries, a dynamic design to create multiple types of more or less informal seating.‎ Details, stitching and matelassé enrich a simple modularity that creates infinite compositions with a timeless aesthetic, from the most classic sofa to the most multifaceted, from the tidiest to the most disjointed.‎",
