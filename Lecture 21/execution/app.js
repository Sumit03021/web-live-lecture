// when js code run create global execution context(GEC) created into two phases memory creation phase (MCP) and code execution phase(CEP)
// all variable and functions get memory separately(MCP) and code run line by line in (CEP).
// firstly MCP run completely then code execution run .

// when a function called then new execution context formed with name of the function in CEP.
